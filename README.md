## Dataset Creation

The provided dataset creation notebook copies videos from a source directory (AR-VIM) into a new dataset folder with user-specified train-test-split ratios. In order to access the AR-VIM dataset in Colab, you must add a shorcut to the dataset in your personal drive. Class balance must be handled using class weights or an external program.
